## Experience

I wish I had more compile time errors. I kept running into errors that really should have been compile time and that would have made development much easier. 
especially with the pug documents. compile time errors just give me feedback faster then runtime errors can so I could figured out what I was doing with pug faster.

I did learn how to use Node.js and integrate it with a database. how to connect request types like GET and POST from a variety buttons to different functions in a script using addresses. then processing that into an SQL request to the database.

I was able to get everything working, and as far as I can tell, without any bugs.

## Known issues or Bugs

I don't think there are but I had issues with changes not rendering after they were made and needing an additional GET to work.
I haven't run into that bug sense making some other changes so I think it's gone.

## Sources used

nothing other then the textbook and lab resources
